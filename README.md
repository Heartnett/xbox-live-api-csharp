## Welcome!

The Microsoft Xbox Live Service API (XSAPI) enables game developers to access Xbox Live. To get access to the Xbox Live service, you can join the Xbox Live Creators Program at https://aka.ms/xblcp, or apply to the ID@Xbox program at http://www.xbox.com/en-us/Developers/id

To learn more about these programs, please refer to the [developer program overview](
https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/games/xbox/docs/xboxlive/get-started/developer-program-overview).

## WARNING!

This repo is no longer active and will be deleted after 9/2017.

Both the C# interop source and Unity plug-in are in active development right now.  To make it easy for developers to get the latest code and avoid double pull requests due using submodules, we have moved our C# interop source to [Xbox Live Unity Plugin](https://github.com/Microsoft/xbox-live-unity-plugin) and will be maintaining it there.
